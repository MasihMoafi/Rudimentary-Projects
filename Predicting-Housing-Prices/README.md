# Predicting Housing Prices

A machine learning project focused on predicting housing prices using regression techniques.

## Overview
This project aims to develop models that accurately predict housing prices based on various features. It explores different regression techniques and feature engineering approaches to improve prediction accuracy.

## Techniques Used
- Linear Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- XGBoost
- Feature Engineering
- Data Visualization
- Cross-Validation

## Dataset
The project uses housing datasets containing features such as:
- Square footage
- Number of bedrooms/bathrooms
- Location
- Year built
- Other amenities and characteristics

## Results
The implemented models achieve meaningful predictions with evaluation metrics such as RMSE and RÂ² score indicating their performance.

# AMR Parsing and Summarization

A project focused on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) parsing and text summarization.

## Overview
This project explores the use of Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) for text understanding and summarization. AMR parsing transforms text into a graph representation that captures the semantic meaning, which can then be used for various NLP tasks including summarization.

## Techniques Used
- Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) Parsing
- Semantic Graph Analysis
- Text Summarization
- Natural Language Processing
- Graph Visualization with LangGraph

## Key Features
- AMR parsing of input text
- Visualization of semantic graphs
- Graph-based text summarization
- Evaluation of semantic preservation

## Work Hours Analysis - Linear Regression/ Polynomial Regression

This is my first project. The goal was to analyze my personal work hours and perform linear regression on the dataset. The code includes data visualization using box plots and violin plots, as well as a regression analysis using gradient descent. Then applying polynomial regression to see if we get better results which we do!
